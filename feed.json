This started as a project pitched by Ed Fennell to the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS), which I then helped take upon a leader role in helping push this cause forward.</p>\n<h3>2025 Colloquium for the Improvement of Nonverbal Patient Care Technologies (CINPCT)</h3>\n<p>This colloquium was aimed at bringing awareness among academia, industry and students about how various existing technologies can come together to create assistive devices for nonverbal people. It was a mostly student-run conference, with the assistance of Dr. Juergen Hahn and Ed Fennell.</p>\n<p>To access the website for the conference, click <a href=\"https://www.cinpct.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.
